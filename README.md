# rEFInd-bootloader

You must install rEFInd first
https://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/installing.html

and also the ursamajor-rEFInd theme https://github.com/kgoettler/ursamajor-rEFInd.

I have made a pull request with my icons, but until then you can also use mine: https://github.com/lytjedk/ursamajor-rEFInd

But really you do not have to. The just 3 icons I have added are all in this repository. And my background is not committed. (I am not sure where I have it from. I hope it's fine, if not I suppose it's better that it's only here, so I can remove it quickly). I am not sure, but I am almost sure the image I used was free. And I think I have changed it a bit too. Mainly darken it, to make it a nice background that doesn't take too much attention.

My boot screen:

For now. I suppose I will change the setup. But for now I am playing with immutable Linux's. And espcially Nix seems _very_ interesting. But icons for most common distributions are already in ursamajor. Or you could take a look at: https://github.com/erikdubois/ursamajor-rEFInd Erik Dubois have added more icons than I have, just not any that I need. But perhaps you do?
